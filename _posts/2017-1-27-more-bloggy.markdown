<h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
Once I had the planning of my layout it was time for the high-fidelity mockups. High-fidelity closely matches the visual and interaction designs the final product is likely to have. Generally high-fidelity prototypes are meant to incorporate everything that comprises the final product at that stage.

Instead of having a top nav bar for the links to the anchor tags as I had earlier, for easier navigation and a better layout I put the link in Table of Contents form.




<h4>Version 1.0</h4>

</div>




<h4>Version 2.0</h4>
After receiving some input from my Creative Director on my version 1.0 high-fidelity mockups, I positioned the TOC-style links into a side nav bar for better UI. Having the navigation links on the side, the user can easily move from one section to another without having to go to the top of the page.

<h3>The Final Mockup</h3>

Using some parts of my design, my Creative Director put together the final mockup which would guide us into the actual coding of the Ad Spec page and how it should appear when completed.
