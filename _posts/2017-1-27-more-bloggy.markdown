##High-Fidelity Mockups
Once I had the planning of my layout it was time for the high-fidelity mockups. High-fidelity closely matches the visual and interaction designs the final product is likely to have. Generally high-fidelity prototypes are meant to incorporate everything that comprises the final product at that stage.

Instead of having a top nav bar for the anchor tag links, I set up the links in a table of contents format for easier navigation.

###Version 2.0
After receiving some input from my Creative Director on my version 1.0 high-fidelity mockups, I positioned the TOC-style links into a side nav bar for better UI. Having the navigation links on the side, the user can easily move from one section to another without having to go to the top of the page.

##Revised Mockup
After receiving some input from my Creative Director on my first high-fidelity mockups, I positioned the TOC-style links into a side nav bar for better UI. Having the navigation links on the side, the user can easily move from one section to another without going to the top of the page.

##The Final Mockup

Using some parts of my design, my Creative Director created the final mockup, which would guide us in how the page should look when it was time to code.
