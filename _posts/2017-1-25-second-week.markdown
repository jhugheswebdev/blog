title: Ad Specs Page  - 'All By Grand Design'

[//]: # (Planning/Wireframes)
This week I was tasked with designing and developing a static single page site for the Sales and Ad Ops team. The problem, use cases and solution as presented below.

Design is an iterative process, I sketched, wireframed, revised my wireframes, created mockups, revised those mockups, until eventually some form of final design emerges.

###The Problem
It's difficult for Sales and Ad Ops to provide product specs and examples to clients. Doing so requires them to manually aggregate the ad specs and ad examples applicable to the client (typically from past emails, campaigns, etc.), organize them into some presentable format and then email it to them.
###Primary Users & Use Cases
  1. Sales : to easily provide details on and examples of specific placements that a client is considering; a supplement to the media kit that gets more granular, not a replacement for the media kit;
  2. Ad Ops : an easy to link site that provides technical details, due dates, and examples for clients. Source of record for specs of our placements.
  3. Customers / Clients : easily accessible; self-service reference documentation.

###The Solution

Design and publish a single page app that includes product descriptions, specs, placement examples, and any other reference information that will help support client engagement efforts from Sales and Ad Ops.

Whether the solution involves one page or multiple pages, clients should be able to easily understand what placement they are providing specs for; Sales and Ad Ops must be able to share links to specific placements to avoid any client confusion about what placement they need to be aware of.

###Planning

First, I had to do some strategizing about how users would navigate the page. I wanted to ensure the navigation UX was intuitive and the UI simple. Too many product links in a top nav bar would make the page look cluttered and result in a poor user experience. The more navigation links a page has, the more overwhelming it seems, and the less likely users will figure out what to do.

After getting more concise product copy from the Sales/Ad Ops team, I sketched a wireframe of the layout utilizing a top nav bar.

Initially, I broke up the products into higher level categories. Each top nav button would take you to a listing of the products in that category, and each listing would have a "Details" button. Clicking on the "Details" button would drop down specifics about each product.

This is the product detail page I envisioned for each product listing. I thought the user/client would want to see a visual example of the ad first, followed by the technical specifications.

After some further thought and conversations with my Creative Director, I revised my pen and paper mockup to have all the specifications and information on top, before the visual examples because most of the clients that would use this page already know what the ads/examples would look like. We wanted to make sure the visual hierarchy of the page allowed users to quickly find all the information they were looking for.
