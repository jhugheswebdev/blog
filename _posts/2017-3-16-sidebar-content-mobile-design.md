title: Designing sidebar content for a mobile view
---
## The Problem
Currently, the sidebar content is only viewable on large screens. Design, construct and make accessible the selected sidebar content for small and medium screen views.

_Sidebar on large screen view_

There were several questions I asked before planning:
* The current mobile main page shows 25 articles, Would I be allowed to drop the articles listed to 15 or 20?
* Should anything be shown before the sidebar content boxes?
* Should an accordion style dropdown be considered for the sidebar content?

I created several different wireframes to visualize what would best meet the requirements. I revised those wireframes down to two of the best options. I took those two wireframes and developed them into mockups using the [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) app.

_Medium fidelity prototypes implementing images_

I ran these mockups by my Creative Director, and we agreed upon the design that closely resembled how the sidebar appeared on the main page. Choosing this design would allow us to utilize already existing code from the sidebar. This would meet all the requirements for the assignment given.

_Medium fidelity prototype utilizing existing design_

The unselected design implemented an image and would rely on the editorial staff selecting high-quality images consistently. This could pose a problem if the images selected are not high-quality, and those images on mobile might slow load time for the site.

The chosen design could use the existing code, making it more efficient and time-saving than creating brand new code from scratch for aesthetic appeal. This design does not include images, including images in the sidebar design would not add much to the user experience.

This is a major learning point that Iâ€™ve been taught at Industry Dive, you have to think of the user first, and what kind of user you accommodate for. You can read more about this in my previous blog [here](http://www.jhugheswebdev.com/user-interface-design/).
