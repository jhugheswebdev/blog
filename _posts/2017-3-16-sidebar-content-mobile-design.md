title: How do you design sidebar content for a mobile view?
---

I was assigned the task of making our sidebar content accessible on small and medium screen views, currently, the sidebar content is only viewable on large screens.

There were several questions I needed to ask before I started planning:
The current mobile main page shows 25 articles, Would I be allowed to drop the articles listed to 15 or 20? Less scrolling for the user to get to the sidebar content.
Should anything be shown before the sidebar content boxes?
Should an accordion style dropdown be considered for the sidebar content?

I created several different wireframes to see what would be the most efficient to meet the requirements. I revised those wireframes to two of the best options that met the requirements. I took those two wireframes and fully detailed them into mockups using the Sketch program.

I ran these mockups by my Creative Director, and we agreed upon the design that closely resembled how the sidebar appeared on the main page.  

The design that was not chosen implemented an image and would rely on the editorial staff picking high-quality images consistently. This could pose a problem if the images chosen were not high-quality, and those added images on mobile may slow load time for the site.

The design that was chosen could use the already existing code, making it more efficient to implement and more time-saving than creating brand new code just for aesthetic appeal without adding much to the user experience.

This is a major learning point that Iâ€™ve been taught at Industry Dive, you have to think of the user first, and what kind of user you accommodate for. You can read more about this in my last blog [here](http://www.jhugheswebdev.com/user-interface-design/).
