This is it! I'm finally here, making my transition into an entirely different career. I don't think I could have picked a better company to start with. A lot of firsts in my first week alone, my first experience in a startup culture, my first company meeting, my first job indulging my creative side.

Transitioning from being a D.C. Firefighter/EMT for over 9 years into a web developer and designer. I think I may have taken the longest, most roundabout route to get here, but this exactly where and what I want to be. I credit all that I've learned to the Web Development Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly and I credit my GA Outcomes counselor for keeping me focused on making a successful transition to this career. It combines the two sides of intellect that I hunger for the most, creativity and logical problem solving.

Iâ€™m eager to learn more about design, get seasoned as a front-end developer, and hopefully be able to contribute more than just a little bit to the company.
