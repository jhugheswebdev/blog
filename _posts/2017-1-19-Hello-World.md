This is it! I'm finally here, making my transition into an entirely different career. I don't think I could have picked a better company to start with. A lot of firsts in my first week alone, my first experience in a startup culture, my first company meeting, my first job indulging my creative side.

Iâ€™m eager to learn more about design, get seasoned as a front-end developer, and hopefully be able to contribute more than just a little bit to the company.
