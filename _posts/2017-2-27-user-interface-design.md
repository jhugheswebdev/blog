title: What I've learned about User Interface Design
---

A significant learning point for me, as a part of the Industry Dive design team, is the user first mentality. Above form is the function, and above all is the user. Up until this point, I haven’t had to put much thought into meeting the exact needs of a customer or user. I’ve also learned how in order to have an effective design, users must be able to easily recognize what it is, understand what the interface is interacting with, know what will happen when they use it and successfully interact with it.

## Form Follows Function
Form follows function is a modernist architecture principle coined by architect [Louis Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan)that the shape of an object or building should be based primarily on its function. This principle also applies to user interface design.
I’ve learned that design is not all about flash & the "wow" factor, it's not about how many snazzy animations you can fit onto a site. It's about using this flash & "wow" in more calculated & strategic ways. To call attention to what is important on your site/application and not to overwhelm the user with too much. Treat your user’s attention wisely and you will get better results.

## Be Obvious
You have to let the user know what to expect at every turn, give them insight about what will happen if they follow *this* link, or click *that* button. Don’t worry about stating the obvious for the user, if there is an image of a hamburger menu, put text next to it stating that its a menu. If there is search input, a magnifying glass icon may not be enough, put some text saying search next to it. What’s obvious to you, may not be obvious to the user.  This keeps the user from unplanned outcomes or surprising interactions.

## Keep The Basics Simple
I’ve also learned that users find comfort when things behave the way they expect, a user should be able to predict how an interface element will behave just by looking at it. If it looks like a button it should be a button. Don’t get fancy with the basics of interaction, keep it simple and predictable. Elements that look the same should be the same, stay consistent. Visual hierarchy and visual weight have been an integral part of the fundamentals I’ve learned. The viewing order of the visual elements on the screen should be clear, if you change the visual weight of an element, you may have to change the visual weights of the other elements to achieve a balanced hierarchy.

## The Goal
One of the first things I learned about Industry Dive’s design philosophy is their use of color to highlight certain things and to guide the attention of the user to where they want. This results in more interaction and views to things like their newsletter, which in turn, results in more ad space sales, which equals more money for the company.
