title: What I've learned about User Interface Design
---

A significant learning point for me, as a part of the Industry Dive design team, is the user- first mentality. Above form is the function, and above all is the user. Until interning at Industry Dive, I did not have to put much thought into meeting the exact needs of a customer or user. I’ve also learned that, in order to have an effective UI design, users must easily and intuitively able to accomplish their goals.

## Form Follows Function
Form follows function is a modernist architecture principle coined by architect [Louis Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan). The idea is that the shape of an object or building should be based primarily on its function, rather than aesthetics. This principle also applies to user interface design. I’ve learned that design is not all about the flash and “wow” factor. It’s not about how many snazzy animations you can fit onto a site. It’s about using this flash and “wow” in more calculated and strategic ways to call attention to what is important on your site/application and not overwhelm the user. Treat your user’s attention wisely, and you will get better results.

## Be Obvious
You have to let the user know what to expect at every turn. Give them insight about what will happen if they follow this link, or click that button. If there is an image of a hamburger menu, put text next to it stating that it’s a “menu.” If there is a search input, a magnifying glass icon may not be enough, put in some text saying “search” next to it. What’s obvious to you may not be obvious to the user. And, even if it is obvious, UX research shows that clearer calls to action boost engagement.

## Keep The Basics Simple
I’ve also learned that users find comfort when things behave the way they expect. A user should be able to predict how an interface element will behave just by looking at it. If it looks like a button, it should be a button. Don’t get fancy with the basics of interaction. Keep it simple and predictable. Elements that look the same should be the same. Stay consistent. Visual hierarchy and visual weight have been an integral part of the fundamentals I’ve learned. The order of the visual elements on the screen should be logical and clear. If you change the visual weight of an element, you may have to change the visual weights of the other elements to achieve a balanced hierarchy.

## The Goal
One of the first things I learned about Industry Dive’s design philosophy is their use of color to highlight certain things and guide the attention of the user. This strategic use of color helps both the user and business achieve its goals. The user can intuitively navigate the site and find important information. The business can direct users to take specific actions – like signing up for a newsletter – that helps drive revenue.
