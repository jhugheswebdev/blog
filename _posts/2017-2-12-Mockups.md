title: What's the difference between Wireframes and Mockups?
---

As [Jesse Shawl](https://twitter.com/jshawl), one of my GA web development instructors, used to tell us: “An hour of planning, saves you 10 hours of coding.” I keep that advice in mind anytime I start a new project. I use my wireframes to visualize a general layout of the website or app. The few times I haven’t properly planned before building a site or application, things sometimes haven’t gone smoothly. Starting with a solid planning stage is paramount to success when it comes to development or design.

## Wireframes
As a burgeoning junior web developer, I was accustomed to creating wireframes as part of the planning before I coded any application. Wireframes are developed usually using simpler and cheaper technologies, often just pen and paper, to give a better picture of the final output. Wireframing can save time and money, in either the design or development phase, saved time can mean saved resources.

## Mockups
Creating mockups are a new thing for me, something I wasn’t taught in the Web Development course. I first learned of mockups through the UX Design cohort that ran concurrently at GA with my Web Development cohort. I got to see how they planned and created their designs for sites/applications. When the UXDI students had presentations of their latest projects, I tried to attend as many as I could. I asked them questions about what programs they were using to create their mockups, often Sketch and InVision. They created static mockups with these programs, as well as interactive ones.
I learned why and how a mockup could be used when I joined the Industry Dive design team. A static mockup gives the reviewer a clear picture of how the final product will look without interactions. It also allows clients, investors, and stakeholders to better understand and visualize the functionality – the user experience – of the final product.
Designers love mockups because they help them examine visual hierarchies, see if any of the elements visually clash, and easily communicate their ideas with team members.

## Interactive Mockups
I also learned the difference between a static mockup and an interactive mockup, and when each should be used. Interactive mockups are what I was viewing when I attended the UXDI cohort’s design presentations. They had interactions that worked as if they were actual websites, but they did not use code. This allows the user to visualize the link or interaction between elements before any coding occurs, again saving time and resources. An important thing I’ve learned since joining the Industry Dive team is to never wireframe, mockup or code without having a proper plan and to keep the user in mind.
