I transitioned from being a 9-year D.C. Firefighter/EMT into a Web developer/designer. I may have taken the longest, most roundabout route to get here, but this exactly where and what I want to be.  This career combines the two sides of intellect that I hunger for the most, creativity and logical problem solving.

I never thought I could find a career that would challenge me, and reward me for learning new things every day. There are new experiences gained and new lessons learned each day. I strive to be better and look forward to new problems to solve.

I came across a saying that best describes my journey so far:
"Find more, think again, work smarter, fail faster, dig deeper.
Save nothing for the swim back."

I'm saving nothing, I'm only going forward and I'm going all-out.
