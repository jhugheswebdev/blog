Transitioning from being a D.C. Firefighter/EMT for over 9 years into a web developer and designer. I think I may have taken the longest, most roundabout route to get here, but this exactly where and what I want to be. I credit all that I've learned to the Web Development Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly. It combines the two sides of intellect that I hunger for the most, creativity and logical problem solving.
